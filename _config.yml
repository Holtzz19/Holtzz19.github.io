          During the pandemic, I finished my twelfth-grade year very early by completing all my online courses as fast as possible. With everything being finished, I got myself a full-time job in shipping. I shipped out all kinds of electronics and did work on the computers within Excel, Shopify, and Shipstation. I worked here until it was time for me to get going to university.

         Some of my best memories were made at this high school. Our classes weren't big, and we were quite literally out in the middle of nowhere, but you won't find a community quite like the one you'd get here anywhere else.
